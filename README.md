# Insufficient Exception Handling in Python Numeric Operations

This repository demonstrates a common, yet easily overlooked, error in Python: insufficient exception handling in numerical operations.  The provided `bug.py` file showcases a function that attempts division but only handles `ZeroDivisionError` and `TypeError`.  This leaves it vulnerable to other numeric exceptions such as `OverflowError`.

The `bugSolution.py` file demonstrates how to improve exception handling to address this vulnerability, enhancing code robustness.

## How to Reproduce the Bug
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.py`.
3. Observe that only `ZeroDivisionError` and `TypeError` are handled.  `OverflowError` will cause a crash if you try it.

## How to Fix the Bug
1. Refer to `bugSolution.py` for a demonstration of more comprehensive exception handling.
2. Employ broader exception handling (e.g., using a `ValueError` exception) to catch a wider range of potential errors in mathematical functions.
3. Consider handling different exceptions individually with detailed error messages for improved debugging and user experience.
